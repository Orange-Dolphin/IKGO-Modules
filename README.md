## Alternate Character Select
The Alternate Character Select provides a different way of selecting a character on the character select. Every row becomes it's own section, which are navigated by pressing up or down, and left or right moves within that section. Only the sections closest to the ones you are hovering over are shown. See the readme in the folder for information on setup.
